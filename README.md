# MLKL and kinase-domain phylogenetic analyses

This repository contains related phylogenetic analyses for MLKL proteins and
broader kinase-domain proteins. It also includes annotation notes for the
Helixer, NLRtracker, and InterProScan steps that generated inputs used by those
analyses.

The upstream Helixer/NLRtracker annotation dataset is archived on Zenodo:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20703384.

## Analyses

| Analysis | Directory | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MLKL kinase-domain phylogeny | [`analyses/mlkl_phylogeny/`](analyses/mlkl_phylogeny/) | MLKL candidate tables, MLKL-NLR pair tables, curated kinase-domain FASTA files, alignments, trees, and scripts |
| Broad kinase-domain tree | [`analyses/kinase_domain_tree/`](analyses/kinase_domain_tree/) | IPR011009 protein/domain tables, combined kinase-domain FASTA files, alignment, tree, tree map, and scripts |

## Annotation Notes

| Step | Directory | What is documented |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genome annotation and NLR/domain detection | [`analyses/annotation/`](analyses/annotation/) | Helixer command example and log-derived settings, NLRtracker command example, and InterProScan version |

Each analysis directory is self-contained and has its own README describing the
files used at each step.
